    title: "Chapter 1: The Birthday Wish",
    description: "At her fifteenth birthday party, Anya Chandra—gifted with mind-bending abilities—feels invisible despite her power. When her father Vikash, Mumbai’s elegant crime boss, orders her to destroy Kiara Sharma (a rising Bollywood actress and daughter of a lawyer who tried to expose him), Anya complies. But her motivation is dual: beyond serving her father’s revenge, she wants to reclaim Aryan Khanna, the boy Kiara took from her at thirteen. Using supernatural gifts inherited from her grandmother, Anya systematically manipulates Kiara through voodoo dolls and clairvoyant intrusion—causing mysterious illnesses, ruining her relationship with Aryan, and destroying her career. The chapter introduces Dilip Shrivastava, a divorced father whose future will intersect with Anya’s, and establishes the Chandra family’s blood-money empire built on Partition-era violence. Anya becomes her father’s weapon, already damned at fifteen.",

    title: "Chapter 2: The High Profile Breakup",
    description: "Anya executes her plan against Kiara with surgical precision. She collects personal items—hair, fabric threads—and creates a voodoo doll, establishing a sympathetic link through her clairvoyant gifts. Over weeks, she inflicts headaches, nausea, and anxiety on Kiara, making her miss crucial events with Aryan’s family. Anya projects her consciousness into Kiara’s mind, twisting conversations and planting paranoia. Meanwhile, Vikash coordinates from his end, spreading industry rumors about Kiara being “unreliable.” The relationship crumbles spectacularly when Kiara must choose between a film reshoot and the Khanna family anniversary party. Aryan ends things, exhausted by three months of chaos. Yet Anya never wins Aryan either—instead, she’ll eventually be drawn to India’s biggest YouTuber, ten years younger, whom her father dismissively calls a “motor mouth.” The real war is only beginning.",

    title: "Chapter 3: The Years of Broken Things (Age 18-28)",
    description: "Three years after destroying Kiara, eighteen-year-old Anya finally attracts Aryan’s attention. But when romance blossoms, her mother Maya intervenes, explaining that marriage between the Khanna and Chandra families would create dangerous complications—Anya knows too many family secrets. Instead, she’s sent to NYU’s Tisch School. There, she meets Jean-Luc Rousseau, a passionate French documentary filmmaker who represents everything her father despises. After three blissful months, Anya is called home for a fabricated family emergency. When she returns, Jean-Luc has been deported due to “visa issues”—clearly her father’s work. She dates a comedian who mysteriously loses all his gigs after making jokes about powerful families. Then Rohan Deshmukh, an assistant director with criminal connections, attempts to drug and blackmail her; he’s efficiently disappeared by her father’s men. At twenty-five, she has an affair with Kartik Mehra, a married cricket star and her father’s best friend—a hysterical relationship ending with both calling each other’s spouses. Every relationship is systematically destroyed, leaving Anya increasingly hollow. By thirty, she’s waiting, broken, accepting her cage.",

    title: "Chapter 4: The Fashion Book Launch (Age 30/40)",
    description: "Forty-year-old Dilip Shrivastava, divorced and struggling with his hyperlocal news website Mumbai Pulse, attends a fashion book launch hoping to see Aditi Sengupta, a married historian he’s attracted to. Instead, he spots Anya Chandra—thirty years old, stunning in a black dress, standing alone and somehow aware of his staring despite never making eye contact. He’s mesmerized by her beauty and sadness. Later, he discovers through Twitter that she’s Vikash Chandra’s daughter and realizes she’d received his email months earlier about featuring her documentary work—she knew who he was all along. The timing feels orchestrated. When Cafe Mangi offers him a significant advertising contract shortly after, he wonders if there’s a connection. The chapter establishes Dilip as an ordinary man—decent, struggling, lonely—about to be drawn into forces beyond his comprehension. Anya, for her part, recognizes him as exactly what her parents have been seeking: controllable, grateful, ordinary enough to seem like her choice.",

    title: "Chapter 5: The Three Meetings",
    description: "Dilip and Anya have three carefully orchestrated encounters. First, at a Devdutt Pattanaik mythology talk where Anya deliberately sits beside him two minutes before the event starts, introducing herself with a mischievous smile. She briefly shakes her leg, her knee brushing his—a calculated intimacy. Second, at an art exhibition where Dilip encounters Vikash Chandra himself, who walks directly toward him radiating surprising warmth while Maya looks worried and Priya (Anya’s sister) pretends he doesn’t exist. The staging is obvious but unspoken. Finally, after Dilip’s persistent emails, Anya agrees to coffee at Gloria Jean’s in Bandra. The café is suspiciously packed—clearly filled with extras by Vikash. They talk for thirty minutes; Anya does most of the talking, asking about his family. When she leaves, her eyes are wet, cheeks flushed. Moments later, the entire café empties simultaneously. That night, Dilip reads her a rambling love letter over the phone. She tells him she’s leaving for New York and has a boyfriend there, then texts: “I’m not too young. I’m 30.” The clarification suggests complications beneath her rejection.",

    title: "Chapter 6: The New York Exile (Age 30-34)",
    description: "Thirty-year-old Anya flees to New York to stay with her pregnant sister Priya and brother-in-law Marco. Her mother suggests she mentor Rohan Bhat, a clueless twenty-year-old wanting to start a YouTube fitness channel. Through video calls, Anya teaches him filmmaking basics, finding unexpected satisfaction in nurturing rather than destroying. Meanwhile, her father shelves her documentary about Mumbai’s hijra community—two years of work killed because she was building independence. Lonely and isolated, Anya begins an affair with her cousin Abhay Malhotra, a McKinsey consultant. She confesses everything to her mother Maya, who responds with surprising directness and warmth, admitting her own loneliness in marriage to Vikash. But Maya must tell Vikash, and warns that Abhay—now knowing family secrets—has become a risk. Worse, Anya develops attraction to Marco, her sister’s husband. When Priya suspects betrayal (nothing physical happened, but the attraction was real), she explodes and throws Anya out. Maya convinces Anya to return to Mumbai, honestly admitting she’s serving Vikash’s orders while also expressing genuine maternal concern. Anya returns home at thirty-two, finally understanding that even her mother’s warmth ultimately serves her father’s control. Her cage is portable, invisible, inescapable.",

    title: "Chapter 7: The Betrayal and the Accident (Age 34)",
    description: "Back in Mumbai at thirty-four, living in her father’s Malabar Hill mansion while her Bandra apartment undergoes endless “renovations,” Anya works as Vikash’s invisible weapon—reading minds, gathering intelligence through supernatural gifts. Her sister Priya hasn’t spoken to her in two years since Brooklyn. Anya finds comfort mentoring Rohan Bhat’s growing YouTube channel and develops genuine friendship with him after her cousin Abhay’s death. Abhay had been compromised—sleeping with Min-Jun Park, CEO of Daehan Industries, and betraying Vikash’s Korean operations (₹3,500 crores in losses). On a Delhi trip, Vikash orders Anya to use her clairvoyant gifts to confirm Abhay’s treachery. She does, discovering his complete betrayal and plans to defect permanently to Korea. The next day, Abhay “accidentally” drowns while swimming in Goa—an obvious assassination disguised as cardiac arrest. Anya is devastated, realizing her intelligence work directly caused her cousin’s death. Rohan provides uncomplicated comfort during her grief, offering friendship without agenda. The chapter reveals the lethal consequences of Anya’s gifts and Vikash’s ruthlessness, while showing Rohan as a genuine, if naive, presence in her increasingly dark life.",

    title: "Chapter 8: The YouTuber’s Rise and Fall (Age 34-39)",
    description: "Twenty-four-year-old Rohan keeps Anya afloat after Abhay’s death with his transparent enthusiasm and growing YouTube success. What neither knows: Vikash’s people have been seeding Rohan’s viral content, controlling his “organic” growth. Rohan dreams of becoming a billionaire like Vikash, studying him at family dinners, working obsessively. Maya initially supports the relationship—Rohan distracts Vikash’s attention from her, allowing freedom for her secret den. But she’s also deeply jealous of Anya potentially becoming “the queen.” Rohan asks Anya to be his girlfriend; she agrees, tired of loneliness. Their relationship seems healthy until Anya goes to Albania for two months on a documentary project. In her absence, Vikash observes Rohan’s content becoming recklessly opinionated—the opposite of Vikash’s meticulously controlled media appearances. Deciding Rohan is unacceptable, Vikash systematically throttles his algorithm performance while scheduling opportunities that make Rohan impossible to be with. The treadmill speeds up. On Valentine’s Day, an orchestrated interview with actress Jhanvi Kapoor (on Vikash’s payroll) produces intimate photos that appear compromising. Anya, hurt by weeks of cancellations, ends the relationship. Rohan spirals into depression before becoming grimly determined to prove his worth. Meanwhile, Dilip has been writing emails to Anya for ten years despite her silence—persistence Vikash notes as potentially useful. At thirty-nine, approaching forty, Anya receives “the talk” from her father about her future, while Dilip continues writing: “Still here.“",
