    title: "Chapter 1: The Birthday Wish",
    description: "At fifteen, mind-bending Anya Chandra feels invisible at her own birthday party. Her father Vikash, Mumbai’s crime boss, orders her to destroy Kiara Sharma—daughter of a lawyer who tried to expose him. But Anya has her own motive: reclaiming Aryan Khanna, whom Kiara stole at thirteen. Using supernatural gifts and voodoo dolls, she systematically ruins Kiara through mysterious illnesses and mental manipulation. The chapter introduces Dilip Shrivastava, a divorced father whose path will eventually cross Anya’s, and establishes the Chandra empire built on Partition-era blood money. At fifteen, Anya becomes her father’s weapon, already damned.",

Anya projects consciousness into Kiara’s mind, twisting conversations while Vikash spreads industry rumors about unreliability. The relationship crumbles when Kiara must choose between a film reshoot and the Khanna anniversary party. Aryan ends things, exhausted. Yet Anya never wins him either—she’ll eventually be drawn to India’s biggest YouTuber, ten years younger. Kiara’s life is destroyed, but Anya’s real war is only beginning.",

Assistant director Rohan attempts drugging/blackmail and disappears. At twenty-five, she has a hysterical affair with married cricket star Kartik Mehra.

    description: "Forty-year-old divorced Dilip Shrivastava attends a fashion book launch hoping to see historian Aditi Sengupta. Instead, he spots thirty-year-old Anya Chandra—stunning, lonely, somehow aware of his staring without looking. He’s mesmerized. Later discovering she’s Vikash Chandra’s daughter and received his earlier email about collaborating, he realizes she knew who he was. When Cafe Mangi offers significant advertising shortly after, he suspects connections. The timing feels orchestrated. Anya recognizes Dilip as exactly what her parents seek: ordinary, controllable, grateful—someone who’ll seem like her choice while remaining manageable for Vikash’s purposes.",

    description: "Dilip and Anya have three orchestrated encounters. First: a mythology talk where Anya deliberately sits beside him, briefly touching his knee. Second: an art exhibition where Vikash himself walks toward Dilip radiating warmth while Maya looks worried. Third: coffee at Gloria Jean’s, suspiciously packed with extras who leave simultaneously afterward. Anya does most talking, asking about family; she leaves with wet eyes and flushed cheeks. That night, Dilip reads her a rambling love letter by phone. She says she’s leaving for New York with a boyfriend, then texts: “I’m not too young. I’m 30”—a clarification suggesting hidden complications.",

When Anya spends two months in Albania, Vikash observes Rohan’s content becoming recklessly opinionated. Deciding he’s unacceptable, Vikash throttles his performance while scheduling impossible opportunities. Orchestrated Valentine’s photos with actress Jhanvi Kapoor appear compromising.
