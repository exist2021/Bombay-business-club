/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Bombay Reader application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes simplicity and security by leveraging structural segregation.
 * Chapters and Analytics Events are readable by anyone, while write access to Chapters is denied.
 * Donations are writeable by anyone.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /chapters/{chapterId}: Stores chapter data. Publicly readable.
 * - /donations/{donationId}: Stores donation data. Writable by anyone.
 * - /analytics_events/{eventId}: Stores analytics event data. Writable by anyone.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Chapters are read-only. This ensures content integrity.
 * - Analytics Events are openly writeable to support anonymous telemetry.
 * - Donations are openly writeable.
 * - No user-specific data or ownership is enforced in this version.
